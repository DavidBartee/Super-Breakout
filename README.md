# Super-Breakout
An imitation of Super Breakout for the Atari 2600 that I made in my free time as my first C++ project.

Credit to this video (and the original game), from which I yoinked the sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-DMFefFNAU

Note: If you want to compile this, keep in mind that this project uses SDL2 and is targeting x64 (though it could run on x86 just fine). Take a look at SDL setup instructions.txt if you have trouble.
